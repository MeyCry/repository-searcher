Repository Searcher
===================

An app for finding repositories on GitHub.

The code is **intentionally** written **difficult** to demonstrate the possibilities of building an architecture in complex projects.

### Launch

Install Node.js and NPM package manager. And install dependency `npm i`

`npm start` - run project build and start simple server

`npm run build:production` - build for production in to ./public folder

`npm run build` - build for development

`npm run watch` - watch for src changes for development
